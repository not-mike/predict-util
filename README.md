#Prediction-Sim (Agent-based Model)

This simulation explores the distributional wealth impacts of various
"betting strategies" in a prediction market based on American-style, binary
options on the open interval (0,1). Inputs may be predefined or randomly 
assigned. Agents are vested with "beliefs" and may or may not update these 
when presented with new information. Derivative events are artificially 
generated using one or a combination of LÃ©vy processes including: Brownian
Motion, Laplace motion, and/or extensions of these to the Black-Scholes option
pricing framework. Due to difficulties enforcing boundary conditions, all
trading is restricted when market prices exceed these limits. Trading occurs
asyncronously, though modification to allow syncronous or other ordered trades
should be trivial..
