## CSCS530 Winter 2016 Syllabus
#### Complex Systems 530 - Computer Modeling of Complex Systems (Winter 2016)

This is a __tentative__ syllabus; as we learn more about your interests and background, we may tailor the contents and timeline to better meet our overall class demographics.  Notably, you'll initially see some large gaps that we'll fill in as we proceed.

Grading will be based primarily on a research project (80%); for masters and Ph.D. students, this research project will ideally form the kernel of a chapter of your thesis.  The remainder of our grade will be determined by three "notebook checks" (30%), which will demonstrate your exploration and experimentation with programming and modeling concepts.  (N.B.: 80+30>100, so that you may either "catch up" on missed project points or treat one notebook as optional)
